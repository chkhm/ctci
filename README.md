Practicing playground for coding riddles

_Remark:_ code is written with a certain amount of pragmatism, e.g. using namespace std. In a real 
project most C++ projects would not have a "using namespace std;" line.

_Remark:_ this is just for the fun of it. No guarantees for correctness,I would not recommend using
any of this code for real projects.
